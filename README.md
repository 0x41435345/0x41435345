# Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹
My nickname is **Rounnus** and I am an undergraduate student at the **University of Piraeus** in the department of **IT**. The field I like most in **IT** is the one that deals with **embedded systems** because I find it very interesting how a piece of software interacts with the hardware. The programming language I want to "perfect" is **C** because it is the best for programming in **embedded systems** and is a very fast and very powerful language. Also in my free time I write programs, I study for my university or I watch series or a movie.
