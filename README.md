# Introduction
Hello and welcome to my GitHub account! My name is Constantinos, and I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Piraeus. My primary interest lies in embedded systems, a field that demands a solid understanding of computer architecture and low-level programming.

At the university, I focus on studying computer architecture and mastering low-level programming languages such as C, C++, and Assembly. Within the field of embedded systems, I'm particularly interested in the concept of reliability.

I'm also a big supporter of open source software. I'm passionate about its values of accessibility and collaboration in creating programs. 

Feel free to browse through my projects on GitHub. If you have any questions or are interested in collaborating, don't hesitate to contact me.

# Embedded Systems related projects
## University's 
### Convolution Image processing
This project consists of two parts, both written in C. The purpose was to learn about the programming environment provided by Xlink for embedded system development. All tests were executed on a Zybo Z7 development board.

You can find the project repository here: https://github.com/constarg/convolution-image-oparation

### Car detector
This project is written in VHDL. Its purpose was to implement a circuit that checks whether a car enters or leaves a parking space and counts how many cars are already inside, determining if the parking space is full or has available spots.

You can find the project repository here: https://github.com/constarg/car-detector-fpga

### MIPS pipeline efficiency
This project is written in MIPS assembly, and its purpose was to evaluate the efficiency provided by pipeline technology on a MIPS processor.

You can find the project repository here: https://github.com/constarg/MIPS-Increase-efficiency-using-pipeline
