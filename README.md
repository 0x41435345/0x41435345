Welcome to my GitHub, my nickname is Rounnus and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Piraeus in Athens.  The programming language I am trying to perfect is C, mainly to use in projects that have to do with embedded systems.  I'm very interested in hardware and how a software can interact with it using either a low-level programming language, such as assembly, or a high-level programming language, such as C. In my free time I usually make programs, read about  my university or I watch a series or a movie.
