# Introduction
Hello and welcome to my GitHub! My name is Constantinos, and Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at the University of Piraeus. 

At the university, I focus on studying computer architecture and exercising on low-level programming languages such as C, C++, and Assembly. My primary interest lies in embedded systems  and more specifically I'm interested in the concept of Embdedded system reliability.

Feel free to browse through my projects on GitHub.
