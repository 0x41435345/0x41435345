# Introduction
Hello and welcome to my GitHub account! My name is Constantinos, and I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Piraeus. My primary interest lies in embedded systems, a field that demands a solid understanding of computer architecture and low-level programming.

At the university, I focus on studying computer architecture and mastering low-level programming languages such as C, C++, and Assembly. Within the field of embedded systems, I'm particularly interested in the concept of reliability.

I'm also a big supporter of open source software. I'm passionate about its values of accessibility and collaboration in creating programs. 

Feel free to browse through my projects on GitHub. If you have any questions or are interested in collaborating, don't hesitate to contact me.
